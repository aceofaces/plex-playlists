  - Visual mood/genre selector with emoji support
  - Custom scheduling (weekly/daily) or on-demand generation
  - Stored in database with full CRUD operations
  - See src/web/views/playlists/builder.tsx:1-379

#### ü§ñ Playlist Recommendations
- **Smart Recommendations Engine**: Analyzes listening history to suggest custom playlists
  - Identifies your favorite genres based on play patterns and ratings
  - Recommends mood-based playlists from your library
  - Finds complementary genre combinations you enjoy
  - Surfaces underexplored genres for discovery
  - See src/playlist/recommendations.ts:61-517

#### üìä Analytics Dashboard
- **Library Statistics**: Visualize your music collection
  - Genre distribution with interactive charts
  - Mood distribution from Plex metadata
  - Top artists by play count
  - Recent listening activity
  - See src/web/views/dashboard.tsx:1-343

#### üéØ Mood-Based Filtering
- **Mood Support**: First-class mood support throughout the codebase
  - Moods extracted from Plex metadata (separate from genres)
  - Stored in genre cache alongside genres
  - Used in custom playlists and candidate filtering
  - See src/db/schema.ts:56 (moods field added to genre cache)

#### ‚ö° Background Job Queue
- **Job Queue System**: Asynchronous job processing for long-running tasks

  - Job types: playlist generation, cache warming, album caching
  - Progress tracking with real-time updates
  - Cancellation support via AbortSignal
  - CLI-first architecture (same functions, different routing)
  - See src/queue/job-queue.ts:1-183

### Enhancements

#### Selection Algorithm Improvements
- **Epsilon-Greedy Selection**: Balanced exploration vs exploitation
  - 85% exploitation (top-scored tracks) + 15% exploration (diverse random selection)
  - Configurable via `EXPLORATION_RATE` environment variable
  - Exploration phase prioritizes diversity (new artists/genres)
  - See src/playlist/selector.ts:137-237

#### Playlist Metadata
- **Enhanced Playlist Descriptions**: Rich metadata in Plex playlist summaries
  - Total duration in hours:minutes format
  - Track count and date generated
  - Discovery stats (days since play averages)
  - Throwback stats (nostalgia window info)
  - See src/plex/playlists.ts:19-67

#### Cache Management
- **Cache Utilities Module**: Centralized cache TTL and refresh strategies
  - Jittered TTL to prevent thundering herd (90 days ¬±10%)
  - Usage-based refresh prioritization (hot/warm/cold tiers)
  - Batch refresh limits (daily: 250, hourly: 10)
  - See src/cache/cache-utils.ts:1-110

#### Progress Tracking
- **Real-Time Progress Updates**: Track long-running operations
  - Progress stored in database (`job_runs` table)
  - Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming to web UI
  - ETA calculations based on current rate
  - Source tracking for cache warming (plex/lastfm/spotify/cached counts)
  - See src/utils/progress-tracker.ts:1-263

### Architecture Changes

#### Window System Refactor
- **Special Windows Type**: Separate type for discovery/throwback playlists
  - `TimeWindow` for daily time-based playlists (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - `SpecialWindow` for weekly special playlists (discovery/throwback)
  - `CacheWindow` for maintenance jobs
  - Custom playlists now stored in database (not in window definitions)
  - Deprecated `GenreWindow` type removed
  - See src/windows.ts:1-80

#### Database Schema Updates
- **New Tables**:
  - `custom_playlists`: User-defined genre/mood playlists with scheduling
  - Includes: name, genres[], moods[], enabled, cron, targetSize, description
- **Schema Enhancements**:
  - Added `moods` field to `genre_cache` table (JSON array)
  - Added `moods` field to `album_genre_cache` table
  - Added `lastUsedAt` timestamp to both cache tables (for usage-based refresh)
  - See drizzle/0012_fancy_unicorn.sql

#### Utility Functions
- **Duration Formatting**: Human-readable duration display
  - `formatDuration()`: Convert milliseconds to "Xh Ym" format
  - `calculateTotalDuration()`: Sum track durations from Plex Track[] array
  - See src/utils/format-duration.ts:1-34

### Documentation

- Fixed track metadata type in discovery and throwback trackMaps

### Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration File Removal**
- `playlists.config.json` and `playlists.config.schema.json` removed
- Existing genre playlists must be recreated via web UI as custom playlists
- Migration: Use web UI playlist builder to recreate any file-based genre playlists

‚ö†Ô∏è **GenreWindow Type Deprecated**
- `GenreWindow` type removed from codebase
- `getGenreWindows()` now returns empty array
- Custom playlists are stored in database, not returned by window functions

### Performance

#### Cache Warming
- Album cache warming now uses progress tracking (2-phase: metadata fetch + cache write)
- Optimized metadata fetching with 100 concurrent requests
- Better memory management (clear Plex genre/mood maps after use)

#### Playlist Generation
- Discovery playlist uses history API (no full library scan)
- Throwback playlist uses history API with date filtering
- Reduced redundant track fetching via metadata extraction from history
