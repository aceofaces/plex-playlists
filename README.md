# Plex Playlist Enhancer

Automated daily and custom Plex playlists using your listening history, star ratings, and sonic similarity - like Spotify's Daylist, but for Plex and open source.

## What This Does

Automatically generates smart playlists for your Plex music library:

- **üïê Time-Based Daily Playlists** - Morning, afternoon, evening mixes based on your listening patterns
- **üîÆ Weekly Discovery Playlist** - Rediscover forgotten gems from your library
- **‚èÆÔ∏è Weekly Throwback Playlist** - Nostalgic tracks from 2-5 years ago
- **üé® Custom Playlists** - Genre/mood combinations (e.g., "Chill Electronic", "Dark Synthwave")
- **üìä Smart Selection** - Epsilon-greedy algorithm balancing favorites with exploration
- **üì• Rating Import** - Bootstrap ratings from Spotify or YouTube Music exports

**Perfect for:**
- üéß Music lovers with large Plex libraries
- üè† Homelab enthusiasts who want to own their music streaming
- üìä Data nerds who want algorithmic playlists without Spotify

## Key Features

### Intelligent Playlist Generation
- **Epsilon-greedy selection**: 85% exploitation (your favorites) + 15% exploration (discover new tracks)
- **Time-windowed analysis**: Morning (6-11am), afternoon (12-5pm), evening (6-11pm)
- **Discovery mode**: Surfaces tracks you haven't heard in 90+ days
- **Throwback mode**: Nostalgic tracks from 2-5 years ago (configurable window)
- **Cross-playlist deduplication**: No repeats across daily playlists for 7 days

### Smart Scoring
- **Exponential recency decay**: Recent plays weighted heavily (configurable half-life)
- **Star ratings**: Your ratings influence selection (60% weight)
- **Play count normalization**: Balanced against over-played tracks
- **Sonic similarity**: Expands playlists using Plex's audio analysis

### Metadata & Enrichment
- **Multi-source genre data**: Merges Plex, Last.fm, and Spotify metadata
- **90-day caching**: Minimize API calls with intelligent cache warming
- **Rating import**: Bootstrap from Spotify/YouTube Music playlists

### Operations
- **Docker ready**: Full containerization with docker-compose
- **SQLite persistence**: Track history and job execution
- **Cron scheduling**: Automatic playlist updates
- **Job monitoring**: Web UI with real-time progress tracking

## How It Works (Brief)

1. **Analyze** your Plex listening history (last 30 days, filtered by time window)
2. **Score** tracks using recency decay + star ratings + play counts
3. **Select** using epsilon-greedy: 85% top-scored tracks + 15% diverse exploration
4. **Expand** with Plex's sonic similarity if needed to reach target size
5. **Create** Plex playlist and track in database for cross-playlist deduplication
