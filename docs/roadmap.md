- [ ] **Loading states** - Better visual feedback during async operations

#### Playlist Description Updates
- [ ] **Dynamic playlist descriptions** - Update Plex playlist descriptions when regenerating
  - Show last updated timestamp
  - Show generation parameters (genres, moods, time window)
  - Show track count and duration
  - Example: `"ðŸŽ¨ Chill Electronic â€¢ 50 tracks â€¢ Updated 2025-10-10 17:30 â€¢ Genres: electronic, ambient â€¢ Moods: chill, mellow"`

#### Background Job System
- [ ] **Move playlist generation to background workers** - Non-blocking playlist generation
  - Replace synchronous generation with job queue
  - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket or SSE
  - Ability to cancel running jobs
  - Job history and retry mechanism
  - Multiple concurrent playlist generation
- [ ] **Job queue dashboard** - View pending/running/completed jobs with cancel/retry actions

### Medium Priority

#### Genre Management
- [ ] **Genre ignore/blocklist** - Exclude specific genres from playlist generation
  - Global ignore list (applies to all playlists)
  - Per-playlist ignore list (custom playlist overrides)
  - UI for managing ignored genres
  - Persist in database alongside settings

  - Spotify playlist export (reverse sync)
  - CSV export with metadata
- [ ] **Smart playlist templates** - Pre-configured playlist templates
  - "Discover Weekly" - High-rated but rarely played tracks
  - "Throwback" - Older tracks from listening history
  - "Deep Cuts" - Album tracks with low play counts
  - "Genre Explorer" - Expand into adjacent genres

#### Advanced Filtering
- [ ] **Advanced mood filtering** - Energy level and tempo-based filtering using Plex audio analysis
  - Filter by BPM range
  - Filter by energy/danceability scores
  - Filter by valence (musical positivity)
  - Combine with existing genre/mood filters
- [ ] **Date range filters** - Filter history by custom date ranges
  - "Tracks I listened to in 2023"
  - "Summer vibes" (June-August history)
- [ ] **Star rating filters** - Min/max star rating constraints for playlists

## Upstream Library Issues (@ctrl/plex)

These are limitations in the `@ctrl/plex` library that we're working around. Consider contributing PRs upstream:

### Critical Bugs
- [ ] **server.history() ignores librarySectionId parameter** - [Issue to be created]
  - **Impact**: History queries return ALL media types (movies, TV, music) instead of filtering to requested library section
  - **Workaround**: Direct API query to `/status/sessions/history/all?librarySectionID=X` (src/history/history-service.ts:103-135)
  - **Evidence**: Raw API works correctly when passing `librarySectionID` parameter
  - **Upstream PR**: Should fix parameter passing in PlexServer.history() method

### Missing Features
- [ ] **No audio playlist creation support** - [Issue to be created]
  - **Impact**: Cannot use library methods to create/manage audio playlists
  - **Workaround**: Direct API POST to `/playlists?type=audio&...` (src/plex/playlists.ts:21-51)
  - **Upstream PR**: Add AudioPlaylist class and createAudioPlaylist() method to PlexServer

- [ ] **No playlist update/summary methods** - [Issue to be created]
  - **Impact**: Cannot update playlist title, description, or other metadata
  - **Workaround**: Direct API PUT to `/playlists/{ratingKey}?title=...&summary=...` (src/plex/playlists.ts:53-71)
  - **Upstream PR**: Add updatePlaylist() method to Playlist class

### Performance Issues
- [ ] **Default timeout too short for large libraries** - [Issue to be created]
  - **Impact**: Requests timeout when fetching thousands of tracks from large music libraries
  - **Workaround**: Override timeout to 120000ms (2 minutes) in PlexServer constructor (src/plex/client.ts:21)
  - **Default**: 30000ms (30 seconds)
  - **Upstream PR**: Increase default timeout to 60-120 seconds, or add per-method timeout overrides

### Documentation Gaps
- [ ] **History API pagination behavior undocumented**
  - Container-based pagination (`X-Plex-Container-Size`, `X-Plex-Container-Start`) not explained
  - MediaContainer response structure not typed

---

## Rejected / Out of Scope

These ideas have been considered but are not planned:

- **Streaming service integration** - Out of scope; Plex is the only supported backend
- **Mobile native apps** - Web UI is sufficient; responsive design preferred over native apps
- **Collaborative playlists** - Too complex for self-hosted use case
- **AI-powered recommendations** - Prefer algorithmic transparency over black-box ML models
