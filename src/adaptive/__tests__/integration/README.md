# PlayQueue Integration Tests

Integration tests for the Adaptive PlayQueue feature that run against a real Plex server.

## Prerequisites

1. **Plex server** running and accessible
2. **`.env` file** in project root with real credentials:
   ```bash
   PLEX_BASE_URL=http://your-plex-server:32400
   PLEX_AUTH_TOKEN=your-actual-token
   ```
3. **Active playback session** (optional, but recommended for full testing)
4. **Test playlist** with ratingKey `258583` titled "üéµ Electronica" (optional)

## Running Integration Tests

### Run all integration tests:
```bash
INTEGRATION=true npm run test -- src/adaptive/__tests__/integration/
```

### Run with verbose output:
```bash
INTEGRATION=true npm run test -- src/adaptive/__tests__/integration/ --reporter=verbose
```

### Run specific test file:
```bash
INTEGRATION=true npm run test -- src/adaptive/__tests__/integration/playqueue-integration.test.ts
```

## What Gets Tested

### ‚úÖ Non-Destructive Tests (Read-Only)
- **listPlayQueues** - Lists all active PlayQueues
- **getPlayQueue** - Fetches queue by ID with full metadata
- **Queue Tracker** - Tests cache management and failure tracking
- **Queue Version Tracking** - Monitors version increments
- **Test Playlist Verification** - Checks if test playlist is playing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests are READ-ONLY
These tests **do not modify** your PlayQueue or disrupt playback. They only read queue state and verify the API client works correctly.

## Behavior

- **Default (without `INTEGRATION=true`)**: Tests are **skipped** automatically
- **With `INTEGRATION=true`**: Tests run against your real Plex server
- **Missing credentials**: Tests skip with helpful error message

## Expected Output

```
‚úì Plex server configured: http://your-plex-server:32400

‚úì src/adaptive/__tests__/integration/playqueue-integration.test.ts (12)
  ‚úì PlayQueue Integration Tests (12)
    ‚úì listPlayQueues (2)
      ‚úì should list all active PlayQueues
      ‚úì should find queue with undocumented playlistID field
    ‚úì getPlayQueue (3)
      ‚úì should retrieve specific PlayQueue by ID
      ‚úì should include track metadata in PlayQueue items
      ‚úì should throw error for non-existent queue
    ...

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  12 passed (12)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests are skipped
Check that:
1. `INTEGRATION=true` is set
2. `.env` file exists with real credentials
3. `PLEX_BASE_URL` is not `http://localhost:32400` (test default)
4. `PLEX_AUTH_TOKEN` is not `test-token` (test default)

### Connection refused
- Verify Plex server is running
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure `PLEX_BASE_URL` is correct (including port)

### Authentication failed
- Verify `PLEX_AUTH_TOKEN` is valid
- Token may have expired (regenerate in Plex settings)

## Safety

These tests are designed to be **safe** to run against production Plex servers:
- ‚úÖ Only read operations
- ‚úÖ No queue modifications
- ‚úÖ No track removals
- ‚úÖ No playback disruption
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling

The only destructive operations (remove, add tracks) are **commented out** or **not executed** in the actual test implementations.
